Javascript project done as part of the Odin Project web development course. 

Does not involve JQuery because I wanted to exercise pure JS. 

Project involved the following: 

- creating 16x16 grid of even squares via javascript, 
- setting up hover effect that randomly changes the square's color whenever mouse passes over it, 
- adding button to re-create the grid with the number of squares provided by the user (but remaining the same total size), 
- have each repeated pass through the same square add 10 % of black to it.
